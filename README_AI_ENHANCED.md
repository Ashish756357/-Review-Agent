# 🚀 Enhanced AI-Powered PR Review Agent

## Overview

This PR Review Agent now features **enhanced AI analysis** with detailed feedback, comprehensive code review, and actionable suggestions. The AI engine provides in-depth analysis across multiple dimensions including code quality, security, performance, and maintainability.

## ✨ New Features

### 🤖 Enhanced AI Analysis
  - Code style & readability
  - Performance optimizations
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Maintainability
  - Potential bugs
  - Best practices

## Web UI (Flask)

A lightweight Flask web interface is included for quickly running the PR review engine from a browser.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies (recommended into a virtualenv):

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the web UI:

```powershell
python -m src.pr_review_agent.webui
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser. Provide provider (e.g. `github`), repository owner, repo name and PR number. Optionally supply a config file path.

Notes:
- The web UI calls the same review engine used by the CLI. Make sure environment variables or config files provide any required API tokens (for example `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub access).

### 📊 Advanced Metrics
- **Multi-dimensional scoring**: Code quality, maintainability, security, performance
- **Detailed statistics**: Issue counts by severity and category

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup AI Configuration

Create your enhanced configuration file:

```yaml
# enhanced_config.yaml
git_providers:
  - name: github
    api_token: "your_github_token_here"
    base_url: "https://api.github.com"

ai:
  enabled: true
  provider: openai  # or anthropic
  api_key: "your_openai_api_key_here"  # Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  max_tokens: 2000
  temperature: 0.3

analysis:
  enable_security_scan: true
  enable_performance_scan: true
  enable_style_scan: true
  enable_complexity_scan: true

review:
  enable_summary_comment: true
  enable_inline_comments: true
```

### 2. Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` in the config file

### 3. Test Enhanced Analysis

```bash
# Test with your repository
pr-review-agent --provider github --owner YOUR_USERNAME --repo YOUR_REPO --pr PR_NUMBER --config enhanced_config.yaml

# Example with your repository
pr-review-agent --provider github --owner Ashish756357 --repo Resume_new --pr 1 --config enhanced_config.yaml
```

## 📋 What You'll Get

### 🎯 Detailed AI Feedback

Instead of basic feedback, you'll now receive:

```
📊 ANALYSIS RESULTS:
- [WARNING] Variable naming could be more descriptive (style)
  Suggestion: Consider renaming 'x' to 'user_count' for better readability
  Impact: Medium | Lines: 15-17

- [INFO] Missing docstring for function (documentation)
  Suggestion: Add a docstring explaining the function's purpose and parameters
  Impact: Low | Lines: 25-30

- [ERROR] Potential SQL injection vulnerability (security)
  Suggestion: Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
  Impact: High | Lines: 45-47
```
